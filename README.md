# Installation Instructions for MarkLogic v10.0.1 on a PKS K8s Cluster

- MarkLogic installation instructions for a v10.0.1 version of MarkLogic on a PKS v1.5.0 K8s v1.14.5 Cluster 
- I'm using a Mac (not a Windows PC)
- Start by cloning this repo into a `/work` directory:

```
cd /work
git clone https://github.com/rm511130/marklogic
cd /work/marklogic
```

- The [Dockerfile](https://github.com/rm511130/MarkLogic/blob/master/Dockerfile) in this folder points to a MarkLogic-10.0-1.x86_64.rpm file which must exist in the same directory.
- MarkLogic-10.0-1.x86_64.rpm needs to be downloaded directly from [MarkLogic's Product Web site](http://developer.marklogic.com/products)
